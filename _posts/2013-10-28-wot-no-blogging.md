I&#8217;ve published any blog posts here in a while. This doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;ve stopped blogging, in fact I&#8217;m blogging more than I used to at the moment. The difference is that most of my blogging is done at work, where I try to blog at least once a week. The things I blog about at work are much the same as I&#8217;d blog about here, save for any personal projects, so between that and the [Ubuntu Podcast](http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org), I don&#8217;t have much else to post here. If you&#8217;re interested in my work blog, the feed is embedded in the right-hand column of this site.
