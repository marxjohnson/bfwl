Last Friday Isaw a gig I'd been waiting 20 years to see, and it was everything I could have asked for.

I first discovered Bruce Dickinson's solo work by way of Sack Trick, a group formed by Bruce's Skunkworks band after that [rojrct came to an end. For my 16th birthday, my then-girlfriend Harriet gifted me a copy of Scream for me Brazil, a live album recorded in Sao Paulo, Brazil in 1999 to a crowd of abbout 6000. This was me first experience of Bruce's songs in a live setting , and was released shortly before he rejoined Iron Maiden. Aside from a short festival tour in 2002, it appeared he wouldn't be touring his own material again.

It was late 2023 when the Skunkworks Facebook group first heard rumblings of The Mandrake Project, a new solo album from Bruce and long-time collaborator Roy Z. As soon as the tour was announced, I jumped at the chance. The tickets seemed pricey, but for my first (and probably last) chance to see a Bruce solo show? It was worth a bit over the odds. The venue was to be The Kentish Town Forum, a smallish venue I'd been to many times before.

The set opened with, in my opinion, the only choice for such a comeback. Accident of Birth, the title track of Bruce's fourth album. The refrain of "Welcome home, it's been too long, we've missed you" was a sentiment shared by everyone in the room. I had expected what followed to largely consist of new songs, with a few classics thrown in for good measure. While I wouldn't have minded this, I was pleasantly surprised that this wasn't the case.
