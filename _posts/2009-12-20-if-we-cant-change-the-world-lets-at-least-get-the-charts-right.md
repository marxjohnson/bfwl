As I write this, music fans across the UK are rejoicing at Rage Against the Machine&#8217;s &#8220;Killing in the Name&#8221; getting to Christmas Number 1.

This all started last year when someone got fed up of X Factor dictating the charts with it&#8217;s particularly vile brand of manufactured pop. For 3 years running at the time, X Factor had it&#8217;s winner at Christmas number one with a pretty average cover of an otherwise good song. In response to this, a Facebook group was set up to encourage everyone to buy Jeff Buckley&#8217;s version of Hallelujah, instead of the X Factor version. Unfortunately, the campaign died on its arse somewhat and X Factor got it&#8217;s 4th Christmas Number one.

However, this year we saw something even more out there. Instead of encouraging people to buy the original version of X Factor&#8217;s cover, a campaign was set up to get people buying the classic funk metal record &#8220;Killing in the Name,&#8221; previously reaching 25 in the singles chart in 1993, for Christmas number one. The difference this time round, is that it worked.

Why do I care? It&#8217;s not like I listen to pop music, and while I think Rage are an excellent band, they&#8217;re not one of my favourites. I think that point is here that it shows the music industry that people have moved on. Killing in the Name was \*only\* available via download, not on CD, while the X Factor single was available in both formats, yet Killing in the Name still won. There was an expectation that Rage&#8217;s download-only lead would be crushed when the CD single hit the shops, but it wasn&#8217;t. Some people said it wasn&#8217;t work trying anyway, but I&#8217;ve made it pretty clear by now that it was.

I hope that the rest of the entertainment industry pricks up its ears and listens to what&#8217;s going on here. There&#8217;s a huge commercial force out there who aren&#8217;t interested in manufactured crap, and don&#8217;t go into shops to buy their entertainment. They entertainment made with passion, and it available on line, at a reasonable price, where ever they are. Let&#8217;s see it!

P.S. Sorry if that last bit sounded like a Morrison&#8217;s advert.
