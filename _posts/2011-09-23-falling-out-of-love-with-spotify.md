I&#8217;m sitting at my computer about to cancel my subscription to [Spotify Premium](https://www.spotify.com/uk/get-spotify/premium/). They&#8217;d like to know why I&#8217;m cancelling, which is fair enough, so I&#8217;m going to go through the reasons here. It might get a bit long, but hopefully it&#8217;ll be worth reading. If I get a bit passionate I&#8217;ll probably swear a bit too. Stick with it.

### The Short Version

Spotify is no longer worth £10 a month to me.

### The Long Version

There&#8217;s a few reasons why I&#8217;ve decided to cancel my subscription. Once this is for certain: it&#8217;s nothing to do with the service. Spotify as a concept and a technical implementation is excellent. I&#8217;ve used it for about two years, first as a free user then as a subscriber. I will probably continue using it as a free user.

#### No Comment

However, I do have a few issues with Spotify as a company, particularly when it comes to customer service. Lets take a couple of examples.

I have always ripped my music to the free high-quality Ogg Vorbis format, rather than MP3. Spotify also uses Ogg Vorbis for streaming, yet doesn&#8217;t allow you to play your own Ogg files through Spotify, only MP3s. When I questioned their customer support about this I pretty much received &#8220;Fuck off and die, no comment&#8221;. I mean, I&#8217;m not a journalist probing you for a juicy story, I&#8217;m a paying customer who wants to use your software! Is it too much to ask for a proper answer? 

Another fine example of this attitude is [this Get Satisfaction thread](http://getsatisfaction.com/spotify/topics/disk_full_messages_during_sync_when_disk_still_half_empty) pertaining to an issue with the Spotify Android client. Essentially, if you try to use a decent sized MicroSD card to sync your Spotify songs offline, it tells you the card is full and won&#8217;t sync. Spotify&#8217;s initial response was akin to &#8220;have you tried turning it off an on again?&#8221;. After they realised this didn&#8217;t work, they simply said &#8220;We can&#8217;t recreate this&#8221; and stopped responding. That was a year ago. There have been 34 further reports from customers.

#### Pay Per Play

The primary reason I&#8217;m leaving has very little to do with Spotify themselves. It has to do with the other people who make Spotify work: the record companies and musicians.

If you follow my blog you&#8217;ll know that [InsideOut Music](http://www.insideoutmusic.com), purveyors of the world&#8217;s finest Progressive Metal, recently pulled their entire catalogue from Spotify with no warning. They have since posted [a statement explaining why](http://www.insideoutmusic.com/newsdetailed.aspx?IdNews=10183&IdCompany=8). This seems to be a bit of a trend recently, as a [couple](http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2011/09/another-indie-label-pulls-from-spotify.html) of [articles](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110922/11224716052/labels-dropping-out-spotify-are-totally-missing-point.shtml) on from around the web show. The trouble is that, as Techcrunch put it, they&#8217;re &#8220;totally missing the point&#8221;.

InsideOut justify their departure with the sweeping statement that &#8220;Physical sales are dropping drastically in all countries where Spotify is active.&#8221; No shit, Sherlock. Physical sales? Physical sales have been dropping since the invention of the iPod. The noise that these labels make is all focusing on [how much artists get paid](http://uniformmotion.tumblr.com/post/9659997039/release-day-economics). Now if you&#8217;re in a band, correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, but if I want to make sure you get a decent amount of money from me, I&#8217;m not going to buy your CD. I&#8217;m going to pay to come to one of your gigs, and probably buy some merchandise. Am I right?

It actually surprises me how much I, and apparently other people, will pay for gigs and merchandise. Through Spotify, I&#8217;ve discovered some amazing bands who I&#8217;d love to see live. If Arjen A. Lucassen&#8217;s Star One tour the UK, there&#8217;s virtually no ticket price that I&#8217;d consider too much. If I&#8217;d joined Spotify a year later than I did, InsideOut would have already pulled the music, and I wouldn&#8217;t have known that. Every time Iron Maiden play a gig, there&#8217;s a T-shirt which you can only get at that gig, featuring their mascot Eddie. They usually cost £20/£25 a time, and they sell like the hottest of cakes. Stop worrying about how much you get paid per play, start worrying about how people find out when you&#8217;re playing, and that you&#8217;ve got T-shirts to sell them. Spotify can help you do this.

#### Conclusion

When it comes down to it, the problem is that the people responsible for keeping a large portion of the music I love on Spotify don&#8217;t get it. For the service to be worth money to me, they need to get it. I will still keep using Spotify Free as my primary way of discovering new music. Is your music on there?
