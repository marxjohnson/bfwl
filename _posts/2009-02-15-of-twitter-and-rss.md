  So, I've decided to get myself to grips with some modern webby stuff. I'd call it "Web 2.0" but that's a rubbish term. As such, I've now subscribed to a load of RSS feeds and signed up to Twitter. I've also actually decided to start writing stuff in my blog, rather than just having it as an empty page.
  This was all prompted by a presentation at university during one of my web design lessons from the MD of a web design company called ClickFire, who recommended we get involved in as much of this stuff as we can to "keep our finger on the pulse of the industry", so to speak.
  
  My thoughts so far:
  
  RSS is good. I used it many moons ago when I still used Windows and had an RSS reader plugin for <a href="http://trillian.cc">Trillian</a>. I've subscribed to Wired and Slashdot which were the 2 main feeds I read then, along with various other computer related stuff, Linuxy stuff and general news. It's certainly helped me keep up-to-date with the latest and greatest from the computer industry.
  
  Twitter, I'm not sure about yet. My girlfriend said "isn't that a new Facebook type thing?" so I tried to explain it to her. She understood what it was but said she didn't get why people care what you're doing every 10 minutes. I tend to agree with her to the most extent. Besides following Stephen Fry's daily antics, there's not a huge amount I've gotten out of it as of yet, and my only follower is 10 Downing Street, who only added me because I added them. All the RSS is saying that Twitter is on the tipping point of becoming mainstream, but we'll wait and see. All I know is that I waited about as long as I did after hearing about Twitter before joining it as I did with Facebook. When I joined Facebook, about 60% of my friends where on there. None of my friends are on Twitter.
  
  So here's to my Web 2.0 adventure. I'll keep you posted.
