Powering on the GuruPlug was pretty straightforward. Turn the socket on, lights flash, network connects, job done.
  
However, not being provided with any documentation, I was left out in the cold as to how to access it.
  
As I expected, it was configured to use DHCP be default, so I was able to find it&#8217;s IP address from my router. However, I was never furnished with the root password. Luckily for me, someone had created a GuruPlug Quickstart guide on (now defunct) the plugcomputer.org wiki, which contained this nugget of detail (I&#8217;ve since changed it, in case any opportunistic crackers are reading).

<pre>sheevaplug-debian:~# cat /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ lenny main contrib non-free
deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian stable main contrib non-free
deb http://security.debian.org lenny/updates main contrib non-free
deb http://www.backports.org/debian lenny-backports main contrib non-free
deb http://10.82.108.51/kedars/sheevaplug_wifi/builds/packages/ binary/</pre>

The GuruPlug ships running Debian &#8220;Lenny&#8221; 5.0 with a minimal set of packages. The enabled repositories include the standard Debian binary repos, plus backports.org and, bizarrely, a WiFi driver repo pointing to a 10.x.x.x address, presumably left over from the factory install. Disable that, then.

<pre>sheevaplug-debian:~# df -h

tmpfs                 251M     0  251M   0% /lib/init/rw
udev                   10M  708K  9.4M   7% /dev

The base system takes up about half of the 512MB internal flash. Having attached a 1TB hard drive, it only seems sensible to expand the available space somewhat.
  
I won&#8217;t go into the nitty gritty, but suffice to say I used LVM for flexibility, and put /home /usr and /var on their own partitions.

Now that I had somewhere to put a home directory, next step was to create a user. The &#8216;Plug only comes with the root user setup, and logging in as root is poor form, so I set myself up a user with sudo privileges.

A quick reboot to make sure everything&#8217;s working and&#8230; Oh, wait a minute&#8230; it stopped connecting to the network. No worries because whenever you reboot it reverts the wireless to Access Point Mode. Except&#8230; that didn&#8217;t work either. And no remote access means no log in. Ah.

It turns out that I needed to buy a JTAG boards in order to access the GuruPlug&#8217;s serial port. Remember that USB cable I mentioned in [part 1]({{ "/2010/09/guru-plug-part-1/" | prepend: site.baseurl }})? Turns out that the JTAG plugs in to the &#8216;Plug and acts as an adapter. If you clicked that link, yes you&#8217;re reading it right, that&#8217;s Â£30 to get access to my own device.
  
Suffice to say I wasn&#8217;t overly chuffed by the situation. The NewIT website implies that there&#8217;s some sort of Mini-USB connection to the device itself (as was the case with the SheevaPlug) and the only indication otherwise was in the documentation that I was emailed 2 days after I received the device.
  
Fortunately for me, NewIT saw my point of view on this and offered my a discount on the board, which I gratefully accepted. But please be aware that if you&#8217;re looking at getting a GuruPlug for anything other than it&#8217;s out-of-the-box functionality, **buy a JTAG board too!**

So, a day after my email discussion with NewIT&#8217;s customer services, I got my JTAG board. Here it is:

I hooked the funny wiry connectors to the &#8216;Plug and the USB connector to my EeePC, an connected through Minicom

On rebooting, I could see that the LVM devices weren&#8217;t being found. I&#8217;m not sure exactly why this prevented it from connecting to the network, but I&#8217;m guessing there&#8217;s something important in /usr or /var that it couldn&#8217;t access.
  
After [a few posts on the HantsLUG mailing list](http://www.hantslug.org.uk/lurker/thread/20101001.221300.3eac7170.en.html) and analysis of the boot messages, it turned out that the USB disk wasn&#8217;t being &#8220;found&#8221; by udev until after LVM had initialised and scanned the Volume Groups. This in turn meant that the logical volumes weren&#8217;t active when they needed to be mounted, leaving me without a /home /usr or /var.
  
The mailing list and some Googling told me that most distributions had solved this problem with udev rules that re-scan the volume groups when a new device is discovered, but Debian doesn&#8217;t appear to have gotten there yet (at least, not in Lenny). I&#8217;m no master with udev rules, but I do know my way around an init script, so I modified /etc/init.d/mountall.sh (the script that mounts everything in /etc/fstab) to manually re-scan the volume groups before it tries to mount. It&#8217;s not pretty, but it works.

<pre>...
pre_mountall
vgscan # re-scan the Volume Groups
vgchange -a y # Activate the Logical Volumes
if [ "$VERBOSE" = no ]
then
        log_action_begin_msg "Mounting local filesystems"
        mount_all_local
        log_action_end_msg $?
else
        log_daemon_msg "Will now mount local filesystems"
        mount_all_local
        log_end_msg $?
fi
post_mountall
...
</pre>

So, now I can get back to business setting up the software. Join me again in part 3!
