### Day 2

The second day of Dev8D started with my Moodle Plugins workshop. It was reasonably well attended and the people who were there seemed to find it useful. I certainly found it an enjoyable experience.

After lunch I attended Jack Franklin&#8217;s sessions on [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/). It&#8217;s a really interesting idea, and next time I&#8217;ve got some Javascript to write I&#8217;ll try writing CoffeeScript instead to see if it really does save me time and effort.

The project zone had a brilliant demo of the &#8220;ghetto touch-table&#8221; from the University of Southampton &#8211; basically a home-made Microsoft Surface-style set-up. The thing that really interested me about it was it&#8217;s simplicity &#8211; a sheet of Perspex with IR light shining through it, and a camera to pick up light that gets reflected down by an object touching the surface. It only had a few purpose-built apps that could use the touch functionality, but I&#8217;d love to see it again once they&#8217;ve got it controlling the OS.
