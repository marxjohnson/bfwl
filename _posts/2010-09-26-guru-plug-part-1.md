A few months ago I pre-ordered a GuruPlug, [GlobalScale](http://www.globalscaletechnologies.com/)&#8216;s new plug computer, and the successor to the SheevaPlug.
  
I&#8217;ve been wanting to run a home server for a while, to act as a web server as well as performing a few other always-on functions, but I&#8217;ve not been willing to pay the cost of running my desktop 24/7. Drawing under 5 Watts of power, the GuruPlug satisfies this need perfectly.
  
On Friday I finally received an email telling me my GuruPlug had been shipped, and on Saturday it arrived in the post.

### Specs

The idea of plug form-factor machines is that everything is housed in the plug, that is to say, a block about the size of a plug with an integrated power transformer. Think along the lines of an Ethernet-over-mains adapter.
  
In the GuruPlug Standard, you get:

  * A 1.2 GHz Processor
  * 512 MB of RAM
  * 512 MB of NAND Flash
  * Wifi b/g
  * Bluetooth
  * 1 GB Ethernet Port
  * 2 USB 2.0 Ports
  * U-SNAP I/O for home automation devices

In the &#8220;Plus&#8221; model, you get an additional GB Ethernet port, a MicroSD slot and an eSATA interface.

### Packaging

Upon opening the bag the &#8216;Plug shipped in, I was expecting a nondescript corrugated affair to await me inside, but instead I was presented with a rather nicely printed box, with a satisfying magnetic catch holding the lid shut.

Opening up, the box contains

  * The plug
  * A 3-pin adapter for plugging directly in to the wall
  * A 2-pin adapter for attaching a longer cable, if you want to sit the plug on a desk/shelf/etc
  * Said longer cable with a 3-pin adapter
  * A USB to Mini-USB cable (The Plug aparrently has a Mini-USB interface on the site, but with a non-standard connector and no adapter provided)
  * A Cat5e Ethernet Cable

A notable omission from this contents list is any sort of setup instructions or documentation whatsoever. Not such a good start.

### Size

[<img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/5025028969_7ffb507f82.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Guruplug next to a tape measure and deck of cards" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/52817101@N05/5025028969/ "IMAG0140 by marxjohnson00, on Flickr")
  
Here&#8217;s a quick indication of the size &#8211; the unit&#8217;s about 10cm long, slightly wider and longer than a deck of cards, and about as deep as 3 stacked on top of each other.

### Setup

[<img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4147/5026157468_c04cf603c0.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Assembled GuruPlug" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/52817101@N05/5026157468/ "IMAG0141 by marxjohnson00, on Flickr")
  
Here the plug&#8217;s been assembled with the 3-pin adapter, ready to go.

I&#8217;ve hooked up the Plug to a 1TB hard drive in a USB enclosure, to allow me to use it for NAS/UPnP functionality. I&#8217;ve also plugged it into the router. As you can see it&#8217;s a cheap-as-free Netgear Special from my ISP, and the WiFi&#8217;s a tad dodgy, so while I could just connect the Plug wirelessly, I&#8217;d rather the security of the wired connection.

Powering on, you get a nice display of LEDs on the front of the unit. Lacking any documentation, I don&#8217;t know what any of these mean, by they look pretty cool. Also note the decision to print the logo such that it&#8217;s upside down when plugged directly into the wall.
  
It&#8217;s notable that the Plug is completely silent when powered on. Unfortunately I can&#8217;t say the same for the hard drive.

So the hardware set-up&#8217;s all gone pretty well. Join me in part 2 for the software setup!
