So, this was going to be my blog post to promote OggCamp and tell everyone to come. However, **just 5 days** after the event was announced, the **200 tickets** have sold out.

## So what the hell is OggCamp?

[OggCamp](http://oggcamp.org) is an annual celebration of Open Technology, including [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org) music, art, literature, Open Source software, open data, and anything else that&#8217;s generally geeky and hackable. It&#8217;s organised by [The Ubuntu UK Podcast](http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org) and [Linux Outlaws](http://linuxoutlaws.com). This year will be the third that the event has run, and the first one I&#8217;m involved in organising, and it looks like it&#8217;s going to be a blast.

## When/Where is it?

The event&#8217;s being held at the [Farnham Maltings in Farnham](http://www.farnhammaltings.com/), Surrey on the 13th and 14th of August. The &#8220;official&#8221; hotel is the [Aldershot Premier Inn](http://www.premierinn.com/en/hotel/ALDWIL/aldershot), which is a short drive, train ride or a very long drunken stumble away.

## It sounds amazing, but I don&#8217;t have a ticket! What do I do now?

As I mentioned, the event is now sold out. All ticket registrations are handled through [EventBrite](http://oggcamp11.eventbrite.com/). I&#8217;d suggest watching the page like a hawk for any cancellations, and snap up the tickets. Did I mention that the event is **free** for all attendees?
