excerpt: |
  Last September I recieved a Tweet from my friend/former boss and LUGmaster <a href="http://tonywhitmore.co.uk">Tony Whitmore</a> asking me if I was free that evening.  Tony is one of the founding presenters of the <a href="http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org/">Ubuntu UK Podcast</a> and it was recording night. 3 out of 5 members of the team weren't available, leaving just him and <a href="http://www.lauracowen.co.uk/">Laura</a>, his girlfriend and co-presenter.  Suffice to say "The Laura and Tony Show" wasn't the sound they were after, so they asked me if I'd be up for popping down the road and joining it.
  
  Being a fan of the show, I jumped at the chance.
  
  After what must only have been 6 or 7 episodes (although it was so much fun it felt like a lot more), it was Christmas and time to call and end to season 3 of the show. However, after a couple of months off we're rested and we're back, this time doing things a little differently...
  
  The big change we're making is the move to an official live stream of the show.  There'll be details of how to listen on the <a href="http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org/live/">Live page</a> with links to how you can get involved during and after the show, via <abbr title="#ubuntu-uk-podcast on freenode">IRC</abbr>, <a href="http://twitter.com/uupc">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://identi.ca/uupc">Identica</a>. Of course, if you want to get in touch in between shows you can still use <a href="mailto:podcast@ubuntu-uk.org">email</a> and <abbr title="+44 (0) 845 508 1986">voicemail</abbr>, just like before.
  The show will go live on Tuesday evenings, from about 8.30 until 9.30 PM UK time, which is another change for us. We used to record on Monday, edit on Tuesday, and release on Wednesday. Now the plan is to stream and record on Tuesday, and release a relatively un-edited recording on the Wednesday as before.  The first show is <strong>this tuesday, 1st of March</strong>.
  
  The other major change is the website. We had a brilliant theme designed for us by <a href="https://whyareyoureadingthisurl.wordpress.com/">Andrew Higginson</a>, the man responsible for the <a href="https://launchpad.net/kazam">Kazam Screencasting tool</a> among other things. He even designed us a cool new logo, what a nice guy!  If you see him, buy him a beer.
  
  So tune in to us at about 8.30 this tuesday. All details will be on <a href="http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org/">The Website</a>. And if you've not listened before, well this is the perfect time to give it a go!  Even if you're not an Ubuntu user, it's certainly not all we talk about - if you're at all interested in computers and technology, have a listen. Go on, if you've read this far, you totally want to.
