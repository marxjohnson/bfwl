So you&#8217;re loving JonoBoard, the smash hit Jono Bacon sound board for Android, but Ubuntu Phone is on the horizon!  How will you get your Jono Bacon audio fix on this shiny new platform? Fear not, for JonoBoard has now been ported to QML, the development framework for Ubuntu Phone apps!

You can download the app as it stands [from the github page](https://github.com/marxjohnson/JonoBoard).  You&#8217;ll need to download some bits to get it to run on desktop Ubuntu, instructions are in the readme.

But wait! There&#8217;s more! One Jono Bacon sound board not enough for you? It&#8217;s your lucky day, because [ali1234 has made one too](https://github.com/ali1234/jono-qml)!
