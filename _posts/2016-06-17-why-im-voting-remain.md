First up, I&#8217;m not an expert on the UK&#8217;s relationship with the EU. Let&#8217;s face it, who is? I got a B in A-level politics about 10 years ago, so I have a general understanding of the mechanism by which EU law effects us, but that&#8217;s about as far as it goes.

The question posed by the referendum isn&#8217;t one of whether we change in one direction or another. It&#8217;s whether we keep the status quo, or change from it. However, the situation we&#8217;d change to is entirely unclear. There may or may not be benefits to changing. It seems like in the short term things might be chaotic, but in the long run they might be better, for some people, or they might not, and the post-leave plan is so vague (we don&#8217;t even know who&#8217;ll be deciding or implementing it) there&#8217;s no way to tell.

The uncertainty is the issue I have here. If we had some clear idea about what leaving the EU meant, it might be worth consideration. But since it&#8217;s so unclear, a vote to leave is essentially saying that the current situation is so terrible that literally anything would be better than what we&#8217;ve got. I don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s the case, so that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m voting remain.
