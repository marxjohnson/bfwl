I&#8217;ve just arrived from from [OggCamp](http://oggcamp.org) that took place in Canterbury last weekend.  As usual, I hosted a Lightning Talks session on the Saturday where 8 speakers delivered a series of 5 minute talks.  Among those was Rachel.  This was her first OggCamp, and she gave an off-the-cuff talk titled &#8220;Newbie to tech&#8221;.  She shared a bit about her job (I wasn&#8217;t expecting to hear the phrase &#8220;I grow eyeballs in a lab&#8221; this weekend), and her new found interest in wearable electronics.

The reason this was my favourite talk of the weekend is what this shows we&#8217;ve achieved with OggCamp. We&#8217;ve managed to create an event where someone new to the subject matter and to the community feels welcome and comfortable enough to stand up in front of everyone and say, &#8220;Hi, this is me.&#8221;  I think that&#8217;s pretty fantastic.
