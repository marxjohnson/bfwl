      <h1 class="u">Maths Teacher's Words of Wisdom</h1>

	  <p class="left">When I was still to young to drink,<br />

        My teacher taught me how to think,<br />

        You can lead a horse to water but you can't paint him pink.<br />

        There's ne'er been a man of whom I'm fonder,<br />

        Absence makes your arms grow longer,<br />

        A rolling stone won't gather moths,<br />

        He was seldom never ever wrong.</p>

      <p class="left"><span class="burt">OUR MATHS TEACHER SPEAKS WORDS OF WISDOM!</span><br />

        He's always got a wise reply;<br />

        <span class="burt">OUR MATHS TEACHER SPEAKS WORDS OF WISDOM!</span><br />

        'Though his brains are made from apple pie!</p>

      <p class="left">All other teachers said he was past it,<br />

        Never put both legs in one basket,<br />

        An early bird is prone to catch worms, so always stay in bed 'till last.<br />

        Never look a clothes horse in the mouth,<br />

        Handsaws and hawks look the same in the south,<br />

        Out of sight is often behind,<br />

        He was the only hero of my youth!<br />

        An apple a day keeps the tigers away,<br />

        When the sun shines it's quite a nice day,<br />

        Spare the rod and boil the child,<br />

        I'd hang on every word he'd say!</p>

      <p class="left"><span class="burt">OUR MATHS TEACHER SPEAKS WORDS OF WISDOM!</span><br />

        He's always got a wise reply;<br />

        <span class="burt">OUR MATHS TEACHER SPEAKS WORDS OF WISDOM!</span><br />

        'Though his brains are made from apple pie!</p>

      <p class="left"><span class="burt">OUR MATHS TEACHER SPEAKS WORDS OF WISDOM!</span><br />'Though we never found out why;<br /><span class="burt">OUR MATHS TEACHER SPEAKS WORDS OF WISDOM!</span><br />With a paisley purple kipper tie!</p>
