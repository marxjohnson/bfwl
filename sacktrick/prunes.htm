      <p class="left"><span class="bob">Right! Go Away! Get out of my sight!</span></p>



      <p class="left">When I was still to young to drink,<br />

        My teacher taught me how to think,<br />

        You can lead a horse to water but you can't paint him pink!<br />

        There's ne'er been a man of whom I'm fonder,<br />

        Absence makes your arms grow longer,<br />

        A rolling stone won't gather moths,<br />

        He was scarcely never ever wrong.<br />

        LET'S GO!</p>



      <p class="left"><span class="burt">OUR MATHS TEACHER SPEAKS WORDS OF WISDOM!</span><br />

        <span class="deli">He's always got a wise reply;</span><br />

        <span class="burt">OUR MATHS TEACHER SPEAKS WORDS OF WISDOM!</span><br />

        <span class="deli">'Though his brains are made from apple pie!</span></p>



      <p class="left">All the other teachers said he was past it,<br />

        Never put both legs in one basket,<br />

        An early bird is prone to catch worms, so always stay in bed 'till last.<br />

        <span class="deli">Never look a clothes horse in the mouth,<br />

        Handsaws and hawks look the same in the south,<br />

        Out of sight is often behind,<br />

        He was the only hero of my youth!</span><br />

        An apple a day keeps the tigers away,<br />

        When the sun shines it's quite a nice day,<br />

        Spare the rod and boil the child,<br />

        <span class="fpa">I'd HANG ON EVERY WORD HE'D SAY!!</span></p>



      <p class="left"><span class="burt">OUR MATHS TEACHER SPEAKS WORDS OF WISDOM!</span><br />

        <span class="burt">OUR MATHS TEACHER SPEAKS WORDS OF WISDOM!</span><br />

      <p class="left"><span class="burt">OUR MATHS TEACHER SPEAKS WORDS OF WISDOM!</span><br />

      <span class="deli">'Though we never found out why;</span><br /><span class="burt">OUR MATHS TEACHER SPEAKS WORDS OF WISDOM!</span><br />

      <span class="deli">With a paisley, purple, kipper tie.</span></p>
