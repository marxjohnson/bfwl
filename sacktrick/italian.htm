      <h1 class="u">I'm in a band with an Italian Dummer</h1>
      <h2>This track was used as a B-Side on the "Back From The Edge" 7" picture disc.<br />
      And the chorus fits suspiciously well with that of "Mabel"...</h2>
      
      <p class="left">I'm in a band with an Italian drummer,<br />
And all the girls just fall in his lap. <br />
I'm in a band with an Italian drummer,<br />
But for a foreigner he's quite a nice chap. <br />
 <br />
<span class="fpa">He just cooks pasta, always faster <br />
He smokes with his father, makes good carbonara <br />
His cock's too long to fit in this song <br />
He shaves his legs and always thinks about sex <br />
His hands have blisters, don't trust him with your sisters<br />
He talks baloni and eats rigatoni <br />
His name's on his sticks, he's got smelly armpits <br />
And when he plays his drums it sounds like...</span> <span class="burt">THIS.</span><br />

 <br />
<span class="fpa">He's really Italian, He's hung like a stallion  <br />
He never takes a rest from chasing breasts and legs  <br />
He hates Peter Criss but he still likes Kiss  <br />
And when he plays his drums it sounds like</span> <span class="burt">THIS.</span><br />

...do you know someone like this?</span><br />
<br />
I'm in a band with an Italian drummer,<br />
I'm in a band with a foreign chap. <br />
 <br />
(I'm in a band with an Italian drummer,<br />
I'm in a band with a foreign chap.) <br />
<span class="deli">Well son, it was like this you see.<br />
 We met him down the pub one day and erm... <br />
 He seemed like a right geezer at the time.<br />
 Then when we uh, well.<br />
 It was we gave him a fucking saxophone <br />
 That we discovered he was a fucking drummer weren't he!<br />
 Fucking cunt! <br />
 Y'know, I mean, anyway, y'know<br />
 So we got rid of the saxophone player and erm... <br />
 Put this drummer on instead. And there was...<br />
 There was a star born really. <br />
 And there's nothing we can do about it really.</span><br />
 <br />
I'm in a band!<br />
In a band!<br />
In a band!...<br />
<br />
<span class="bpa">Hey, are you fucking talking to me, aye? <br />
<br />
Minchia! Minchia! Minchia! E' come se metti del <br />
peperoncino nel culo di una porta che scoreggia nuvole di nero. <br />
E poi c'era una vacca... Io non ho capito che dice questo<br />
ragazzo inglese... Non mi ricordo. <br />
Ehi Vito, ma che cazzo dice, eh ?! <br />
E te l'ho detto, io non capisco una minchia questo <br />
ragazzo straniero.  <br />
  <br />
Ah, were they fucking talking to you, eh? Ah, think so! <br />
Andate a 'fanculo!"<br />
