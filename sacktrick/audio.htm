Video,<br />
Rappin' on a talk show.<br />
Tellin' everbody how great I feel.<br />
<br />
Spendin' my money,<br />
Vegas on Sunday.<br />
Makes me wonder what is real.<br />
<br />
<span class="lba">Would you take me if I was a superstar?<br />
Would you take me home to show your friends?</span><br />
Show me how your bedroom lights cast shadows on the wall?<br />
<span class="lba">And Won't you catch me, catch me when I...</span><br />
<br />
Feel like Mr. Popularity,<br />
Fits so easy.<br />
Theres no hard times when you reach the top.<br />
<br />
Signin' my autograph,<br />
Driving my Cadilac,<br />
Seein' my picture in the record shop.<br />
<br />
<span class="lba">Would you take me if I was a superstar?<br />
Would you take me home to show your friends?</span><br />
Show me how your bedroom lights cast shadows on the wall?<br />

Catch me when I fall.<br />
<span class="lba">Won't ya catch me, catch me, catch me when I Fall?</span><br />
Won't ya catch me when I fall?<br />
