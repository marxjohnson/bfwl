<body class="main">

      <h1 class="u">Shoelaces</h1>

      <p class="left">Saw you,<br />

        Saw you on the TV,<br />

        You were lookin' cheeky,<br />

        <span class="alf">All dressed up in your birthday suit.</span></p>

      <p class="left">It's been a long time,<br />

        Long time since I saw you,<br />

        The colour of your hair's new,<br />

        <span class="alf">And that shade of green really does not suit you.</span></p>

      <p class="left">But the picture,<br />

        Picture's not quite watertight,<br />

        Something here is not right,<br />

        <span class="alf">And I think I've spotted the flaw:</span></p>

      <p class="left"><span class="burt">NEVER LEAVE YOUR SHOELACES UNDONE!</span></p>

      <p class="left">Careful,<br />

        You really ought to watch it,<br />

        In case you tread in dog shit,<br />

        <span class="alf">You never know what germs it might contain.</span></p>

      <p class="left">You should tie them, <br />

        Tie them in a double knot,<br />

        Avoid a casual trouble spot,<br />

        <span class="alf">An easy mistake, anyone can make.</span></p>

      <p class="left">Next time,<br />

        Try to be more wary,<br />

        These small things can be scary,<br />

        <span class="alf">Never underestimate life's trivia:</span></p>

      <p class="left"><span class="burt">NEVER LEAVE YOUR SHOELACES UNDONE!</span></p>

      <p class="left"><span class="burt">NEVER LEAVE YOUR SHOELACES UNDONE!</span></p>

      <p class="left">Saw you,<br />

        Saw you on the telly,<br />

        Sucking in your belly,<br />

        <span class="alf">When do you find the time to oxygenate?</span></p>

      <p class="left">Pushing, <br />

        Pushing all your chest out,<br />

        Tryin' to block the rest out,<br />

        <span class="alf">Still blissfully unaware of the fate that awaits.</span></p>

      <p class="left">You stop, stumble,<br />

        A stumble becomes a mumble,<br />

        A mumble becomes a stumble,<br />

        <span class="alf">And it's too late to heed the warning;</span></p>

      <p class="left"><span class="burt">NEVER LEAVE YOUR SHOELACES UNDONE!</span></p>

      <p class="left"><span class="burt">NEVER LEAVE YOUR SHOELACES UNDONE!</span></p>

      <p class="left"><span class="burt">NO, YOU MUST<br />

        NEVER LEAVE YOUR SHOELACES UNDONE!</span></p>

      <p class="left"><span class="burt">NEVER LEAVE YOUR SHOELACES UNDONE!</span></p>

      <p class="left"><span class="burt">NEVER,<br />NEVER,<br />NEVER NEVER EVER LEAVE YOUR SHOELACES UNDONE!!</span></p>
