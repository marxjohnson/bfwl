<h1 class="u">Extra Lyrics</h1>

<p class="left">If you're a Kiss fan (and you should be), after reading the
lyrics on this site, you may be in some confusion. Many of the covers contain
lyrics that don't belong. But which are they, and where do they come from?<br />
Read on...
</p>
<h2>Deuce</h2>
<p>Just before the end is the line:</p><ul>
<li>"Six Foot, Hot Look, All-American Man," from the song <em>All American Man</em> (Alive II)</li>
</ul>


<h2>All Hell's Breakin' Loose (wid da funky groovz)</h2>
<p>The second chorus contains the lines:</p><ul>
<li>"Hard Luck Woman, ya got to choose," partly taken from the song <em>Hard Luck Woman</em> (Rock &amp; Roll Over)</li>
<li>"Rock all night, party every day!" taken from the song <em>Rock 'n' Roll All Nite</em> (Dressed to Kill)</li></ul>
<p>The song fades out to the lines:</p><ul>
<li>"I found out, really found out, what makes the world go 'round" taken from the song <em>What Makes The World Go 'Round</em> (Unmasked)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Love Her All I can</h2>
<p>Somewhere in the middle are the lines:</p><ul>
<li>"Out on the streets for a living,
Picture's only begun.
Your day is sorrow and madness,
Got you under their thumb." From the song <em>Black Diamond</em> (Kiss)</li>
</ul>

<h2>I Still Love You</h2>
<p>After the second chorus are the lines:</p><ul><li>
"You need my lovin' baby oh so bad, You're not the only one I ever had, So if you say you wanna set me free, Don't you know you'll be a misery?" from <em>Calling Dr. Love</em> (Rock &amp; Roll Over)</li>
<p>Towards the end are the lines:</p><ul><li>"That's what it will be, There's someone better than me, No, you never will find, Another love like mine" from <em>A Million to One</em> (Lick It Up)
</ul>
<h2>The Elder</h2>
<p>The last chorus of <em>I</em>  contains the lines:</p><ul>
<li>"Sorry to have taken so long, Must've been a bitch when we's gone" from the song <em>100,000 Years</em> (Kiss)</li>
</ul>
