      <h1 class="u">The Turd That Just Wouldn't Flush</h1>

      <p class="left">Well, don't know who laid him, <br />

        or how he go there.<br />

        No-one will claim him he waits in his lair.<br />

        He's born as a tortiose but he's grown day by day,<br />

        Now he's a porpoise, and he comin' to play,</p>

      <p class="left">He's the turd that just wouldn't flush.<br />

        To leave us, he's in no rush.<br />

        Slimey and smilin' he grins at us all,<br />

        Creeping and crawling and climbing his wall.<br />

        He's the turd that just wouldn't flush, just wouldn't flush. Oh, no.</p>

      <p class="left">Pilein' up since Monday,<br />

        And he ain't gone away.<br />

        Now it's come Sunday and he's ready to stay.<br />

        He's vicious and mean,<br />

        With a sultana eye,<br />

        His mouth is a baked bean that's gaping and wide,</p>

      <p class="left">He's the turd that just wouldn't flush.<br />

        To leave us, he's in no rush.<br />

        Slimey and smilin' he grins at us all,<br />

        Creeping and crawling and climbing his wall.<br />

        He's the turd that just wouldn't flush, just wouldn't flush. Oh, no.</p>

      <p class="left">Flushing and flushing,<br />

        It has no effect.<br />

        Brushing, and brushing, <br />

        But it won't give up yet.</p>

      <p class="left">Woke up one morning, Richard was gone.<br />

        While we were snoring, he'd said "so long" <span class="alf">(so long, buddy!)</span><br />

        In a strange way I miss him, <br />

        Since he's been gone. <br />

        We'll never forget him, <br />

        So thick and so long,</p>

      <p class="left">He's the turd that just wouldn't flush.<br />

        To leave us, he's in no rush.<br />

        Slimey and smilin' he grins at us all,<br />

        Creeping and crawling and climbing his wall.<br />

        He's the turd that just wouldn't flush, just wouldn't flush. </p>

      <p class="left">No, just wouldn't flush...</p>
