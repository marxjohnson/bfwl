      <h1 class="u">Blue Ice Cream</h1>

      <p class="left">This, is the lengthly, Some may say overlengthly tale of

        two boys, John and Steven, for those are the names by which they wish 

        to be known, and their epic and dilligent search for <span class="lba">DAQUARI ICE CREAM!</span> 

        Oh, who said that? <span class="lba">DAQUARI ICE CREAM!</span> Oh, you lot. Well, the particular 

        point about <span class="lba">DAQUARI ICE CREAM</span> is that while we are quite used to ice creams 

        and sorbets, of many shades and colours; from pink, through brown to green,

        Daquari is the only one to my knowlege that's</p>

      <p class="left"><span class="burt">BLUE ICE CREAM!</span><br />

        It's their favourite!<br />

        <span class="burt">COOL AND CLEAN!</span><br />

        And they love it!<br />

        <span class="burt">BLUE ICE CREAM!</span><br />

        For the flavour,<br />

        And they won't stop searching 'till they find it!</p>

      <p class="left">Up until relatively recently, say, twelve to a dozen years 

        ago, the presently grail-like quest for <span class="lba">DAQUARI ICE 

        CREAM</span> would have taken the boys no further than their local Dayville's 

        31 Flavours, but in this new age of peace and prosperity, <span class="lba">DAQUARI 

        ICE CREAM</span> had become one of the many victims of the Cold War, which 

        also saw the break up of the Soviet Empire, civil war in Ugoslavia, and 

        the fall of the Romanian dicataror <span class="lba">NIKKI CEAUSECU</span>. 

        While the tyrant of Bucharest has not been greatly missed, Dayville's 

        has, as it was the only retail outlet that sold</p>

      <p class="left"><span class="burt">BLUE ICE CREAM!</span><br />

        It's their favourite!<br />

        <span class="burt">COOL AND CLEAN!</span><br />

        And they love it!<br />

        <span class="burt">BLUE ICE CREAM!</span><br />

        For the flavour,<br />

        And they won't stop searching 'till they find it!</p>

      <p class="left"><span class="alf">Woah, woah, oh,<br />

        Yeaheyeah,<br />

        Now listen...<br />

        Those boys keep searching for the purest blue ice cream,<br />

        Searching and searching for their elusive, frozen dessert dream!<br />

        Dessert dream!</span></p>

      <p class="left">The boys' quest eventually lead them to a small newsagent, 

        just off Earl's Court Road, where due to a postal error there had been 

        no cold war. Indeed, trabants still drove freely while several small, 

        Easten-European sattelite nations huddled in grotty bedsits filled with 

        state oppression. There, needless to say, they found the elusive frozen 

        dessert, in quite literally land that time HAD forgotten. However, it 

        wasn't long at all before the CIA caught up with them and sold the newsagent's 

        off, with bits of coloured concrete masquerading as the Berlin Wall. Here 

        ended the strange but true story of <span class="lba">DAQUARI ICE CREAM!</span> Well, nearly there's 

        still a chorus;</p>

      <p class="left"><span class="burt">BLUE ICE CREAM!</span><br />

        It's their favourite!<br />

        <span class="burt">COOL AND CLEAN!</span><br />

        Yeah, they love it!<br />

        <span class="burt">BLUE ICE CREAM!</span><br />

        For the flavour,<br />

        And they didn't stop searching 'till they found it!</p>
