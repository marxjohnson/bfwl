        whether you'r coming down to this gig tonight coz I couldn't actually 

        remember whether you're going to play or not. Well, you're busy so

        I guess that if you're coming you'll be playing and if you're, playing

        you'll be coming, and if you won't then you're busy so that kind of answers

        the whole thing! Anyway, I shall quit waffleing to your silly mobile - answering

        machine - whatever it is and get on down, ready to rock. I shall see ya later.
