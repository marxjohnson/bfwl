<h1>Bonus Track</h1>
<h2>Sack Trick couldn't possibly fit every Kiss cover they recorded on the CD,
so here's clips of the ones they didn't...</h2>

<h2>Do You Love Me?</h2>
<p>
You really like my limousine<br />
You like the way the wheels roll <br />
You like my seven inch leather heels <br />
And goin' to all of the shows, but <br />
<br />
Do you love me?<br />
Do You love me?<br />
Really love me?<br />
Do you love me?<br />
</p>
<h2>I Love It Loud</h2>
<p>
Stand up, you don't have to be afraid,<br />
Get down - love is like a hurricane.<br />
Street boy, no I've never been tamed,<br />
You'd better believe it.<br />
<br />
Guilty until I prove innocent,<br />
Whiplash, heavy metal accident.<br />
Rock on, I want to be President,<br />
'coz I love it.<br />
<br />
Loud, I wanna hear it loud,<br />
Right between the eyes!<br />
Loud, I wanna hear it loud,<br />
Don't want no comprimise!
</p>
<h2>to be filled in later</h2>
<p>
</p>
<h2>C'mon And Love Me</h2>
<p>
Baby, baby, don't you hesitate,<br />
'Coz I just can't wait!<br />
Baby, won't you take me down on my knees?<br />
You can do what you please,<br />
<br />
C'mon and love me!<br />
C'mon and love me!<br />
C'mon and love me!<br />
C'mon and love me!<br />
C'mon and love me!<br />
C'mon and love...
</p>
<h2>God of Thunder</h2>
<p>
I! Am the lord of the wasteland!<br />
A modern day, man of steel!<br />
I gather darkness to please me!<br />
And I! Command you to kneel,<br />
Before the<br />
<br />
God of Thunder,<br />
And Rock 'n' Roll!<br />
The spell you're under,<br />
Will slowly rob you of your virgin soul!

<h2>Psycho Circus</h2>
<p>
Hello!<br />
Here we are,<br />
Here I am, We are one.
I've been waiting for this night to come<br />
<br />
Get up!<br />
Now it's time for me to take my place.<br />
The make-up runnin' down my face,<br />
We're exiled from the human race. <br />
<br />
You're in the psy<br />
You're in the psycho circus <br />
You're in the psy <br />
You're in the psycho circus <br />
I say welcome to the show.<br />
</p>
<h2>Sure Know Something</h2>
<p>
I've been gambler, but I'm nobody's fool,<br />
And I sure know something, sure know something.<br />
You showed me things they never taught me in school,
And I sure know something, sure know something.<br />
No one can make me feel the way that you do,<br />
And I sure know something, sure know something.
I've been gambler, but I'm nobody's fool,<br />
And I sure know something, sure know something.<br />
I sure know me face ain't painted,
I bet Cher would've done it.<br />
(I sure know something, sure know something) No doubt.<br />
Can I say that? No? Bloody 'ell.<br />
Sure know something, (Sure know something)<br />
I sure know that I hate Cher.<br />
Saw her arse once, back of a pavillion in Brighton.<br />
By God, it pissed it down.
</p>
<h2>Fanfare</h2>
<p>*Instrumental*</p>
<p>
Oh, Bugger.<br />
<br />
*silence*
</p>
<h2>Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park</h2>
<p>No Need to use thy voice,<br />
Your mind speaks to us!</p>
