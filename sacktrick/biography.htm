<h1 class="u">Biography</h1>
      <p>Way, way back in the 20th Century, 3 members of former Iron Maiden singer 
        Bruce Dickinson's band decided to cut their losses and set out on their 
        own. Before long, Chris Dale (Bassist) put pen to paper and began to wirte.
        The songs that resulted were silly to say the least. The recording soon 
        began, and joining Chris, Alex Dickson (Guitarist), and Alex "Sponder" Elena
        (Drummer), came a wonderful mixture of people from the music world, including 
        Robin Guy (Drummer - Rachel Stamp), Doogie White (Vocals - Midnight Blue, 
        Rainbow), and the entire of Class 4b of Berenger Sauniere Primary School. 
        Before long, (if you take &quot;long&quot; as three years upwards) the 
        songs were recorded and released in the debut album &quot;(Music From) 
        The Mystery Rabbits&quot; (1999, ORG Records). The release was met with 
        delightment by most, and confusion by all.</p>
      <p>It wasn't long before the band began to write a new set of songs, this 
        time with a slightly different vibe, and even more musicians involved. 
        Soon Chris and the band had roped in the aid of the likes of David Ryder 
        Prangley (Vocals - Rachel Stamp), and Jem Davis (Keyboardererer - Midnight 
        Blue), and were recording Penguins On The Moon (2000, ORG Records). Considering 
        it was the first time anyone had ever concieved an operatic musical about 
        astronautic penguins eating cheese and falling in love with electrical 
        appliances, the whole thing was quite a success.</p>
      <p>After 4 more years of frustrating delays, the band's infamous Kiss covers album, Sheep In Kiss Make Up (2004, Sack Trick) was finally realeased in October '04. Featuring a host of Kiss classics with a whole new vibe to them, the album was met with delight by all. Countless musicians joined in the fun this time,
      most noteably Bruce Dickinson (Vocals - Iron Maiden), Reuben Gotto (Guitar - Sokratphorbia, Twin Zero), and Ben Calvert (Drums - Vex Red). <br />So what's next for Sack Trick? Only time will tell...</p>
