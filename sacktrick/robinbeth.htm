<p class="left">Hi babe,<br />
It's, it's me.<br />
Yeah, things are cool, but um, it's gonna be a late one tonight,<br />
Y'know, things are runnin' on?<br />
But um, I, I wrote this song for you.<br />
Check it out.<br />
<br />
Beth, I hear you callin',<br />
But I can't come home right now,<br />
Me and the boys are playin',<br />
And we just can't find the sound,<br />
<br />
Just a few more hours,<br />
And I'll be right home to you.<br />
I think I hear them callin',<br />
Oh, Beth what can I do?<br />
Beth what can I do?<br />
<br />
You say you feel so empty,<br />
That our house just ain't a home.<br />
I'm always somewhere else,<br />
And you're always there alone.<br />
<br />
Just a few more hours,<br />
And I'll be right home to you.<br />
I think I hear them callin',<br />
Oh, Beth what can I do?<br />
Beth what can I do?<br />
<br />
Beth, I know you're lonely,<br />
And I hope you'll be alright,<br />
Me and the boys are playin',<br />
All night,<br />
Ahh-ahhhh.<br />
<br />
Take care baby,<br />
I'll speak to you soon.<br />
Bye!</p>
