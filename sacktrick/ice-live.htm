      <h1 class="u">Blue Ice Cream (live)</h1>

      <h2>As performed on <i>The Bruce Dickinson Rock Show</i>, BBC Radio 6, 8/12/02 (broadcast 22/12/02)</h2>

      <p class="left">This is the strange but true tale of two young boys; John, and Steven, for those are the names by which they wish to be known; And their epic and diligent search for a desert, which hitherto had eluded all of mankind!</p>

      <p class="left"><span class="burt">BLUE ICE CREAM!</span><br />

        It's their favourite!<br />

        <span class="burt">COOL AND CLEAN!</span><br />

        And they love it!<br />

        <span class="burt">BLUE ICE CREAM!</span><br />

        For the flavour,<br />

        And they didn't stop searching 'till they found it!</p>

      <p class="left">The boys' search went on and on over mile, wall, field, and also a fountain; Until they finally found it in a small newsagent just off Earl's Court Road, round the corner from the tube station, you probably know it. Unfortunately, the newsaget also sold pornographic magazines. That held them off for a bit as they didn't realise</p>

      <p class="left"><span class="burt">BLUE ICE CREAM!</span><br />

        Oo, it's their favourite!<br />

        <span class="burt">COOL AND CLEAN!</span><br />

        And they love it!<br />

        <span class="burt">BLUE ICE CREAM!</span><br />

        For the flavour,<br />

        And they didn't stop searching 'till they found it!</p>

      <p class="left"><span class="alf">Those boys keep searching for the clearest Blue Ice Cream<br />

        Searching for somethiiiiing<br />

        Pure and Clean!</span></p>

      <p class="left">Although the boys had found the Blue Ice Cream, they were slightly delusioned by some aspects of it. Mainly the fact that it was sold in packs of two. Why do they do that? How annoying!</p>

      <p class="left"><span class="burt">BLUE ICE CREAM!</span><br />

        Oh, it's their favourite!<br />

        <span class="burt">COOL AND CLEAN!</span><br />

        Yeah, they love it!<br />

        <span class="burt">BLUE ICE CREAM!</span><br />

        For the flavour,<br />

        And they didn't stop searching 'till they found it!</p>
