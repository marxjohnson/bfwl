      <h2>Includes an extract of "Bring the Noise" by <i>Public Enemy</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;over the outro</h2>

      <p class="left">I can't get a job 'coz I can't get out of bed,<br />

        I can't go to college 'coz I've nothing in my head,<br />



        I can't play drums and I can't really sing,<br />

        I've tried to play guitar but it's got far too many strings;</p>

      <p class="left">I Play Bass!</p>

      <p class="left">It's got four strings, I only use two,<br />

        I've never worked out what the others do,<br />

        I Play Bass!</p>



      <p class="left">I'm happy here just strumming along,<br />

        But I'm still not sure how to play this song,<br />

        I Play Bass!</p>

      <p class="left">Well, I can't play drums and I can't really sing,<br />

        Never mind, I'll get another beer.<br />

        I Play Bass!</p>

      <p class="left">I can't play drums and I can't really sing, <br />

        That always seems to go on for so long,<br />



        Now we don't mind if you want to nod off,<br />

        'Coz the bass player's about to show off.<br />

        GO!</span></p>

      <p class="left">So if you can't get a job 'coz you can't get out of bed,<br />

        You can't play drums and you can't really sing,<br />

<span class="burt">How low can you go?<br />

Death row? What a brother knows!<br />

Once again, back is the incredible,<br />

The rhyme animal,<br />

The incredible D. Public Enemy number one!<br />

Five-O said "Freeze!" and I got numb,<br />

Can't I tell 'em that I really never had a gun?<br />

But it's the wax that the Terminator X spun!<br />Go Play Bass!</span></p>
