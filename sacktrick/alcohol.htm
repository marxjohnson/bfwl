<body class="main">

<h1 class="u">Alcoholic Bulimia</h1>

      <p class="left">I don't believe you should drink and drive,<br />

        Too dangerous by far,<br />

        So I made my choice early on,<br />

        I ain't never owned a car.<br />

        I don't belive you should drink and work,<br />

        I smoke while on the hop,<br />

        I've always stuck to my principals,<br />

        I've never had a job.</p>

      <p class="left">I drink and and I smoke and I drink and I smoke and I'm 

        SICK!<br />

        I drink and and I smoke and I drink and I smoke and I'm SICK!<br />

        I don't seem do nothin', 'cept drinkin' and smokin' and chuckin',<br />

        I drink and and I smoke and I drink and I smoke and I'm SICK!</p>

      <p class="left">Now, I've heard tell an 1/8 of skunk,<br />

        Can kill the brain stone dead,<br />

        I've changed my scale and now I'm using metric weights instead.<br />

        By multipying all I smoke by 3.5,<br />

        I've kept my mind baking, but it's still alive!</p>

      <p class="left">Yea!<br />

        I drink and and I smoke and I drink and I smoke and I'm SICK!<br />

        I drink and and I smoke and I drink and I smoke and I'm SICK!<br />

        I don't seem do nothin', 'cept drinkin' and smokin' and chuckin',<br />

        My head ain't doing nothin', 'cept skinning up and supping!</p>

      <p class="left">Now, I control my innards, As good as all the rest,<br />

        But that goes out the window when I'm mixing with the best.<br />

        The rule is moderation,<br />

        But it's yet to dawn,<br />

        'Coz after all the bars are closed it's time for liquid yawn!</p>

      <p class="left">Yea!<br />

        I drink and and I smoke and I drink and I smoke and I'm SICK!<br />

        I drink and and I smoke and I drink and I smoke and I'm SICK!<br />

        I don't seem do nothin', 'cept drinkin' and smokin' and chuckin',<br />

        I drink and and I smoke and I drink and I smoke and I'm SICK!</p>

      <p class="left">I drink and and I smoke and I drink and I smoke and I'm 

        SICK!</p>

      <p class="left">I drink and and I smoke and I drink and I smoke and I'm 

        SICK! <span class="alf">(yee-ha!)</span></p>

      <p class="left">I drink and and I smoke and I drink and I smoke and I'm 

        SICK!</p>

      <p class="left">Wasn't me that was on my knees...</p>
