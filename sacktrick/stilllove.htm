  <title>I Still Love You</title>
</head>
<body class="main">
<h1 class="u">I
Still Love You<br />
</h1>
<p class="left">You
tell me that you're leaving, <br />
And I'm trying to understand,<br />
I had myself believing,<br />
I could take it like a man.<br />

But if you gotta go then you gotta go,<br />
And it's killing me baby.<br />
And all the things you never seem to show, I gotta make you see.<br />
<br />
Girl it's been so long, Now tell me,<br />
Tell me how could it be?<br />
One of us knows the two of us don't belong, <br />
In each others' company.<br />
It hurts so much your telling me goodbye,<br />

You wanna be free.<br />
And knowin' that you're gone and leavin' me behind,<br />
I gotta make you see,<br />
<br />
I
still love you. (<span class="bpa">I still love you</span>)<br />
I still love you. (<span class="bpa">I still love you!</span>)<br />
<br />
People tell me I should win at any cost.<br />

But now I see as the smoke clears away, <br />
the battle has been lost.<br />
<br />
I see it in your eyes you never have to lie, <br />
I'm your life.<br />
Tonight I'll dream away and you can still be mine,<br />
makes me wanna die.<br />
<br />
I still love you. (<span class="bpa">I still love you</span>)<br />

I still love you. (<span class="bpa">I still love you!</span>)<br />
I still love you.<br />
I still love you.<br />
<br />
<span class="fpa">You need my lovin' baby oh so bad,<br />
You're not the only one I've ever had,<br />
So if you say you wanna set me free,<br />
Don't you know you'll be a misery?<br />

I still love you.</span><br />
<br />
And when I think of all the things you'll never know,<br />
There's so much left to say.<br />
And boy, now I see the price of losing you<br />
Will be my hell to pay<br />
My hell to pay, <br />
Each and every day,<br />
Do you wanna stay?<br />
Ah.<br />
<br />
I still love you. (<span class="bpa">That's what it will be,</span>)<br />
I still love you. (<span class="bpa">There's someone better than me,</span>)<br />
I still love you, baby. (<span class="bpa">You never will find,</span>)<br />
I still love you. (<span class="bpa">Another love like mine.</span>)<br />
Yeah, I still love you. (<span class="bpa">That's what it will be,</span>)<br />
 (<span class="bpa">There's someone better than me,</span>)<br />
I want you back. (<span class="bpa">You never will find,</span>)<br />
I want you back. (<span class="bpa">Another love like mine!</span>)<br />

I love those notes.<br />
All those notes.<br />
Just can't get enough, of those notes.<br />
<br />
