      <h1 class="u">I Play Bass</h1>

      <p class="left">I can't get a job 'coz I can't get out of bed,

        I can't go to college 'coz I've nothing in my head,

        I can't play drums and I can't really sing,

        I've tried to play guitar but it's got far too many strings;</p>

      <p class="left">I Play Bass!</p>

      <p class="left">It's got four strings, I only use two,

        I've never worked out what the others do,

        I Play Bass!</p>

        But I'm still not sure how to play this song,

        I Play Bass!</p>

      <p class="left">Well, I can't play drums and I can't really sing,

        I've tried to play guitar but It's got far to many strings;

        The first one was bad this can't be worse.

        I Play Bass!</p>

      <p class="left">I'm still not sure quite why I'm Here,

        Never mind, I'll get another beer.

        I Play Bass!</p>

      <p class="left">I can't play drums and I can't really sing,

        I tried to play guitar but it's got far too many strings;

      <p class="left"><span class="alf">Now we come come to the part of the song,

        That always seems to go on for so long,

        Now we don't mind if you want to nod off,

        'Coz the bass player's about to show off.

        GO!</span></p>

      <p class="left">So if you can't get a job 'coz you can't get out of bed,
