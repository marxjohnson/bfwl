<h1 class="u">What's so good about Sack Trick then?</h1>
      <p>I first encountered Sack Trick at the age of 14, now almost two years back.
      My friend who was a fan of Rachel Stamp had heard them through some fellow fans,
      and told me that I should check them out. I began my quest on MP3.com, where I found
      "I Play Bass". I not only found this track amusing, but it was like nothing else I'd
      ever heard, and completely blew me away. I proceeded immediately to the ORG website
      and sent off for "(Music From) The Mystery Rabbits".<br />
      <br />
      Sitting in my living room at 10pm on a Saturday, I put the CD in the stero and pressed
      Play. It was the point of no return. Immediately I was welcomed with the slap-bass intro
      of "Perfect Today", and took in my first dose of Sack Trick's sheer genious, with the
      first line "I'm sick of casual sex with strangers, Want some strange sex with casualties".
      As the album progressed, I found myself becoming further and further absorbed into the
      intense bass riffs and incredible guitar solos, combined with the sheer randomness
      of the songs such as "No Tomatoes for Me, Thanks" and "The Turd That Just Wouldn't
      Flush".<br />
      <br />
      It was all hilarious. I'd always loved comedy music. But there was something different
      about Sack Trick. They weren't just singing nonsence such as Billy Connelly's "In The
      Brownies", and they weren't crap. As I listened to them more and began to read
      the lyrics, I found that the stuff they were saying made a lot more sense that
      it first seemed. "Maths Teacher's Words of Wisdom", featuring the vocals of the
      incredible Doogie White, contains such lines as "Never look a clothes horse in
      the mouth." At first, this may seem as non-sensical as "In the brownies," but if you
      think about it, it's more sensible than the lyrics of nearly any song you care to
      mention. Try to look a clothes horse in the mouth. You can look all you want, but
      you're likely to find that a clothes horse is has clothes drying on it. After a while,
      your mother's sure to walk in and inquire as to why you're eyeballing you're sibling's
      dripping t-sirts, and you'll feel a fool. Hence the friendly advice, "Never look a clothes
      horse in the mouth."<br />
      <br />
      Sack Trick are almost certainly the most entertaining band you will hear for a long time.<br />
      They are also one of the most talented bands you will ever hear.<br />
      I put it to you to listen to this band and not be amazed. This band will make you laugh
      your arse off and cream your pants at the same time. Some people are put off paying
      &pound;15 for an album where they only like a few songs. With Sack Trick you'll pay &pound;10 for
      an album, and be entertained by <i>every single song</i>. And that's just the albums.<br />
      <br />
      Seen Live, Sack Trick not only impress, they entertain. With the most outrageous range
      of outfits since <i>Monty Python's Flying Circus</i> and an open invitation for
      fans to sing Kiss songs with them, Sack Trick are one of the few bands who you can
      laugh with at the same time as laughing at them.<br />
      If you only ever listen to one band, they should be it.</p>
