&amp; Updates</h1>
<h2>Posted 22/11/06</h2>
<p>Yet again, I haven't updated in a while. Over a year, in fact. Wow. However, it's been rather a quiet year for Sack Trick, since they've been busy making a new album and we all know how long that takes them ;-). Anyway, a few updates: Rockin' Roly Bailey now has a profile on the People page, and I've just uploaded some videos I took from The Underworld in Camden on Monday night, You can find them on the files page. Also, I might give the site a facelift sometime soon. It needs it.<br />Stay tuned!</p>
<h2>Posted 19/07/05 at 6:57pm GMT</h2>
<p>Alrighty then, a nice amalgimation of Sack Trick news from around the world: You can find Chris Dale's interview with Bruce Dickinson on TotalRock is available on <a href="http://www.brucefans.com">Brucefans.com</a> thanks to Nando, despite my failed attempts to record it. Speaking of which, Bruce's interview with Chris can now be heard at <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/shows/bruce_dickinson">www.bbc.co.uk/6music/shows/bruce_dickinson</a>. I'll try and get a recording of it and put it up here before it gets taken off the BBC site.<br />
If you'll navigate your way over to the People page, you'll find Robin Guy has answered my questions after more than 2 years, and now has his profile on there.<br />
Lastly but not leastly, check out the gigs page for info on a couple of upcoming gigs in celebration of Reuben's birthday! Woo!<br />
Oh yeah, and <a href="http://www.chezsacktrick.com">Chez Sack Trick</a> is back up, and about a million times better than ever!

<h2>Posted 1/11/04 at 8:14pm GMT</h2>
<p>Sheep In Kiss Make Up has
finally been released! Sack Trick decided to give up on record
companies and release it themselves, so the CD is now available from
the Mail Order page on Sacktrick.com.&nbsp; The CD itself truly is
a masterpiece, featuring everything from the classic rock <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Shout
It Out Loud</span> to a rap version
of <span style="font-style: italic;">All
Hell's Breakin' Loose</span>, and
even a medley of <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Elder</span>!<br />
Natually, the site has been updated to bring it into line with the
recent changes, meaning you can find details of the CD on the
discorgraphy page, and Lyrics of the album in the lyrics section! <br />
Mark</p>
<h2>Posted 14/10/04 at 8:31pm GMT</h2>
<p>I've been doing a bit of
research on the gigs put up on the official site,
and updated the gigs page with all the details on times, support and
prices I could find.
As well as that, I've put a new section up with Tabs (only 2 songs so
far, but I hope to do
more). You can find it under the Band section.<br />
Also, I've been through the site and corrected some spelling errors and
incorrect lyrics, so It should now all read perfectly! <br />

<h2>Posted 8/9/04 at 10:40pm GMT</h2>
<p><font color="red">We finally

<h2>Posted 4/3/04 at 9:42pm GMT</h2>
<p>Over the last few days I've
been typing up some live variations of songs, and have compiled a page
of miscellaneous lyrics, including a couple not on any albums. You can
find the page on the lyrics section of the site.<br />
Mark</p>
<h2>Posted 15/2/04 at 3:31pm GMT</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the Cardiff gig
next thurday has been cancelled due to lack of available band members.<br />
On a better note, The Ancient Mariner and myself have been busy ripping
and encoding a vast quantity of bootlegs, which are avalible in Mp3
format from the Files section of the site.<br />
Enjoy!<br />

<p>More updates... I've added
details of the upcoming belated KISSmas gigs, and after much nagging,
I've added Liam Richardson to the Staff page, Liam being the site's
main photographer.<br />

<p>Happy new year to all. As a
present for you all, I've added a new gallery of photos from the
KISSmas party at the King's Head - check the pics section. Hope you all
enjoy this latest update - with the band talking about releasing 2 new
albums this year there should be many more on the way!<br />

<h2>Posted 29/12/03 at 2:31pm GMT</h2>
<p>After several months of being
hassled by free hosts, I've gathered some dinero together and purchased
some webspace to host this site on. The KISSmas tour is over, so I have
removed the dates, but as soon as I hear word of the next gigs, the
page will be updated. Fianally, Ive put several Mp3s in the files
section, including various live tracks, a couple of interviews from
TotalRock.com, and a cover of Penguins on the Moon. Stay Silly,<br />
