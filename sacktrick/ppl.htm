      <h2>As you may well notice, there are not many Sack Trick members listed 

        here. This is because although I sent out a questionnaire, many of them 

        were too lazy/busy/drunk/asleep to reply. If you are in the band and feel 

        you should be listed here, send an angry and insulting e-mail demanding 

        a questionnaire to <a href="mailto:mark@barrenfrozenwasteland.com">mark@barrenfrozenwasteland.com</a></h2>

        <span class="narr">What Do You Eat For Breakfast?</span> <span class="lba">&quot;It used to be Guitarists, but I've eaten all of them &amp; there's none left, so I've moved on to cereals now. I mix at least 4 different ones together &amp; it tastes amazing!&quot;</span><br />

        <span class="narr">What's the Most Embarrassing thing you've ever done?</span> <span class="lba">&quot;Picture this: Through boredom whilst travelling to France on a school exchange, I managed to eat biscuits, crisps &amp; nibbles all the way there. The next day, at my exchange students’ house, my body proceeded to produce the largest, rock-solid crap known to mankind. It got totally stuck in their dainty petite little French U-bend. 
The more I tried to ‘move’ it, the more blocked it became. The toilet brush was now fully clogged up, &amp; after about 15 flushes, I began to sweat – especially as they were just outside the groundfloor toilet, in the garden, preparing a lovely lunch…
I panicked when they started to call me, so decided the best thing was to ‘disguise’ my incriminatory evidence…with lots of bog-roll! 
Imagine my surprise (ahem) when the next day I awoke to the sound of French Plumbers (Gendarmes Du W.C.?) huffing &amp; a-puffing over my turd that just wouldn’t flush!&quot;</span><br />

        <span class="narr">What's the stupidest thing you've ever done on stage?</span> <span class="lba">&quot;I once tripped out the power for the whole backline (guitars etc), so had to do a drum solo whilst it was getting fixed. I nearly passed out from heat exhaustion, Because obviously, I was dressed as …A Furry Chicken. Also &lsquo;singing&rsquo; <span style="text-style:italic;">Beth</span>, whilst dressed as A Bald Angel, &amp; A Male Stripper. I occasionally give out roses too.&quot;</span><br />

        <span class="narr">What's Your Favorite Kitchen Utensil?</span> <span class="lba">&quot;I'm particularly fond of The Swedish Cheese Slice, as it ensures uniform slicing-thickness everytime. I also enjoy making &lsquo;Surprise Shakes&rsquo; with my handy electronic hand-whisk. Other than that, a short, sharp serrated knife is a good all-rounder.&quot;</span><br />
