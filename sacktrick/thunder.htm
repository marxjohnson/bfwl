<p class="left">You've
got something about you,<br />
You've got something I need,<br />
Daughter of Aphrodite,<br />
Hear my words and take heed.<br />
<br />
I was born on Olympus,<br />
To my father a son.<br />
I was raised by the demons,<br />
Trained to reign as the one.<br />
<br />
God of thunder,<br />
And rock and roll.<br />
The spell you're under,<br />
Will slowly rob you of your virgin soul.<br />
Oh...<br />
<br />
I'm the lord of the wastelands,<br />
A modern day man of steel,<br />
I gather darkness to please me,<br />
And I command you to kneel<br />
Before the<br />
<br />
God of thunder,<br />
And rock and roll.<br />
The spell you're under,<br />
Will slowly rob you of your virgin soul.<br />
<br />
I, am the lord of the wastelands,<br />
A modern day, man of steel<br />
I, gather darkness to please me,<br />
And I, command you to kneel<br />
Before the<br />
<br />
God of thunder <br />
And rock and roll.<br />
The spell you're under,<br />
Will slowly rob you of your virgin soul,<br />
Your
soul... </p>
