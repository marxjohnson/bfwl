Her All I Can<br />

<span class="lba">I remember the times I was lonely without her,<br />
Now she's mine and I spend my time thinkin' about her,<br />
yeah.</span><br />
<br />
Love her all I can and try to understand,<br />
The things that make her glad,<br />
The things that make her sad,<br />
I'm a lucky guy, I hardly ever try,<br />
And when the world looks bad,<br />
She's never ever sad.<br />
<br />
<span class="lba">She's so easy to please and it doesn't take money,<br />
We can have a good time when the skies aren't sunny,<br />
yeah.</span><br />
<br />
Ah, I love her all I can and try to understand,<br />
The things that make her glad,<br />
The things that make her sad,<br />
I'm a lucky guy, I hardly ever try,<br />
And when the world looks bad,<br />
She's never ever sad,<br />
<br />
<span class="lba">She's so easy to please and it doesn't take money,
(no, no, no)<br />
We can have a good time when the skies aren't sunny,<br />
yeah.</span><br />

Love her all I can and try to understand,<br />
The things that make her glad,<br />

I remember the times<br />
<span class="lba">I remember the times</span><br />
yeah.<br />
<br /><span class="capt">Out on the streets for a living<br />
Picture's only begun <br />
Your day is sorrow and madness<br />
Got you under their thumb</span> <br /><br />
