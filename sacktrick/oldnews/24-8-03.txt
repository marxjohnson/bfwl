I've added a fun thing in the interact section which allows you to upload your 
  own files á la Yahoo! Groups. Use the "Upload" link to upload your files, and 
  the "Files" link to browse the files. Please upload to the appropriate directory 
  and ensure the files are not infected with any viruses before upload!
  Still no news on the release of Sheep in KISS Make-Up, and therefore still no 
  news on gigs :-(
