Welcome to the site. It's up-and-running although slightly lacking in some respects 
(the intro isn't finished yet, for instance). However, all is progressing nicely behind 
the scenes here, and I hope to start up a picture gallery after the June 22nd gig 
(see the gigs section). In the mean time, enjoy the site and tell me what you like/hate/would 
like to see in the future by mailing me here.
Thanks, have fun,
Mark
