Evening all. Over the past few weeks i've been making various small updates to the site, 
but none seemed important enough to justify a news item, so ive put one now for them all. 
Have a look around and you can see what delights ive added for you (I can't remember them, myself). 
In Sack Trick news, there's definately going to be a tour in December, with info on one of 
the gigs being in the Gigs section.

Stay Silly,
Mark
