Expectations<br />

Ha-ha.</span><br />
<br />
You're sittin' in your seat,<br />
'nd then you stand and clutch your breast,<br />
Our music drives you wild along with the rest.<br />
<br />
You watch me singing this song,<br />
And you see, what my mouth can do.<br />
And you wish you were the one that I was doing it to.<br />
<br />
You see me playin' guitar,<br />
And you feel what my fingers can do.<br />
You wish you were the one I was doing it to.<br />
Well, listen;<br />
<br />
<span class="lba">You've
got great expectations.<br />
You've got great expectations.</span><br />
<br />
You're dying to be seen,<br />
And you wave and call my name,<br />
But in the day it seems that I'm a million miles away.<br />
<br />
You watch me beatin' my drum,<br />
And you know what my hands can do,<br />
And you wish you were the one I was doing it to,<br />
Well, listen;<br />
<br />
<span class="lba">You've
got great expectations.<br />
You've got great expectations!<br />
You've got great expectations.</span><br />
<br />
Then you feels these eyes from the stage,<br />
And you see me staring at you,<br />
And you hear between the lines, my voice is calling to you!<br />
Well, listen;<br />
<br />
<span class="fpa">You've got great expectations!<br />
You've got great expectations!<br />
You've got great expectations!<br />
You've got great expectations!</span> (you'd even sell me your soul)<br />
<span class="fpa">You've got great expectations!<br />
Oh,
You've got great expectations!<br />
You've got great expectations!<br />
Oh, We've got great expectations!<br />
You've got great expectations!<br />
You've got...</span></p>
