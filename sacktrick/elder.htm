every place,<br />
In every time,<br />
An Evil is loose, whose sole purpose is to destroy all that is good.<br />
And in every time and every place,<br />
It is the task of The Elder,<br />
To find and train a warrior.</span><br />

<h2 class="left"><a name="2"></a>Just
A Boy</h2>
<p class="left">
<span class="fpa">Who
steers the ship through the stormy sea?<br />
If hope is lost then so are we;<br />
<br />
While some eyes search for one to guide us<br />
Some are staring at me,<br />
But I'm no hero,<br />
Though I wish I could be!<br />
For I am just a boy,<br />
Too young to be sailing.<br />
I am just a boy,<br />
And my future is unveiling.<br />
And I'm so frightened of failing.</span><br />
</p>
<h2 class="left"><a name="3"></a>Odyssey</h2>
<p class="left">
<span class="lba">From
a far off galaxy, <br />
I hear you calling me.<br />
we're on an odyssey,<br />
Through the realms of time and space,<br />
In that enchanted place,<br />
You and I come face to face.<br />
<br />
Once upon not yet,<br />
Long ago someday,<br />
Countless times we've met, met along the way.</span><br />
</p>
<h2 class="left"><a name="4"></a>Only
You</h2>
<p class="left">
<span class="paul">Only
you, <br />
Have the answers.<br />
But the questions you,<br />
Have to find.<br />
Only you,<br />
Know the secrets,<br />
But the truth lies deep <br />
In your mind.</span><br />
</p>
<h2 class="left"><a name="5"></a>Under
The Rose</h2>
<p class="left">
<span class="fpa">Though
I may be pure of heart<br />
And free of sin,<br />
And though you have been chosen<br />
To begin,<br />
And yet I must be worthy of<br />
The prophecy,<br />
But seek and I shall find<br />
My destiny.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="paul">Loneliness
will haunt you,<br />
Will you sacrifice?</span><br />
<br />
<span class="fpa">Do
I take the oath?<br />
Will I live my life</span><br />
<span class="lba">Under
the rose?</span>
</p>
<h2 class="left"><a name="6"></a>The
Oath</h2>
<p class="left">
<span class="lba">Like
a blade of a sword I am forged in flame,<br />
Fiery hot!<br />
Tempered steel fire-bright to the night I take,<br />
I fear not!<br />
<br />
Now compelled by something that I cannot see,<br />
I go forth surrendering to history!<br />
<br />
Your glory, I swear I ride for thee!<br />
Your power, I trust it rides with me.<br />
A servant, I am and ever shall I be.<br />
<br />
Through a dream I have a come to an ancient door,<br />
Lost in the mist!<br />
I have been there a hundred times or more,<br />
Pounding my fists!<br />
<br />
Now inside, the fire of the ancient burns,<br />
A boy goes in and suddenly a man returns!<br />
<br />
Your glory, I swear I ride for thee!<br />
Your power, I trust it rides with me.<br />
A servant, I am and ever shall I be.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="fpa">I
gave my word and gained a key,<br />
I gave my heart and set it free,<br />
There's no turning back from this odyssey,<br />
Because I feel so alive suddenly<br />
And I wonder,</span> <span class="lba">is this
really me?<br />
<br />
Like a blade of a sword I am forged in flame,<br />
Fiery hot!<br />
Tempered steel fire-bright to the night I take,<br />
I fear not!<br />
<br />
Now compelled by something that I cannot see,<br />
I go forth surrendering to history!<br />
<br />
Your glory, I swear I ride for thee!<br />
Your power, I trust it rides with me.<br />
A servant, I am and ever shall I be.</span></p>
<h2 class="left"><a name="7"></a>Mr.
Blackwell</h2>
<p class="left">
<span class="burt">I
never said I was more than I am.<br />
Do what I want, I don't give a damn.<br />
You're all so weak you know it makes me ill.<br />
Don't like you now and probably never will.</span><br />
<br />
You're cold and mean, and in between,<br />
You're rotten to the core!<br />
<br />
You're not well, Mr. Blackwell,<br />
And we can tell.<br />
You're not well, Mr. Blackwell,<br />
Why don't you go to hell?
</p>
<h2 class="left"><a name="8"></a>I</h2>
<p class="left">
<span class="lba">I
was so frightened,<br />
I almost ran away.<br />
I didn't know that I could do,<br />
Anything I needed to,<br />
Then a bolt of lightning,<br />
Hit me on my head.<br />
Then I began to see,<br />
I just needed to believe in me!<br />
<br />
'Cuz I,</span> I believe in me!<br />
<span class="lba">Wo-oah
and I,</span> I believe in something more<br />
Than you can understand!<br />
Yes, I believe in me!<br />
<br />
<span class="lba">You
Know that I,</span> I believe in me!<br />
<span class="lba">Ohh,
yes and I,</span> I believe in something more<br />
Than you can understand!<br />
Yes, I believe in me!<br />
<br />
<span class="lba">Sorry
to have taken so long,</span><br />
Yes I believe in me!<br />
<span class="lba">Must've
been a bitch when we's gone!</span><br />
Yes I believe in me!<br />
Yes I believe in me!</p>

<p class="left"><span class="paul">Morpheus,
you have been summoned here to offer your judgement of the
boy.<br />
Do you still deem him worthy of the Fellowship?</span><br />
<br />
<span class="sga">I
certainly do, my lord. As a matter of fact, Er, I Er, I think you're
gonna like this one. <br />
He's got the light in his eyes, and the right, reet look of a right
champion,<br />
Aye, real champion...</span></p>
