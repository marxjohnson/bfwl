      <h1 class="u">Americans Are Behind</h1>
      <h2>This track was used as a B-side to Skunkworks's "Back From the Edge"</h2>
      <p class="left">Hello!<br />
      <br />
Well I've studied Greenwich Meantime and its different from CET<br />
But in Europe we're all in line, not a great big problem for me, ha, ha! <br />
But over, in the USA, while we're having our tea<br />
They're maybe just getting dressed, well, that's no way to be. <br />
<br />
Americans are behind,<br />
Americans are behind,<br />
Americans are behind,<br />
Americans are behind!<br />
   <br />
Well I called them on the telephone during office hours,<br />
I spoke to their answerphone, some silly mumbling cow,<br />
She said "<span class="lba">I'm sorry we're not open yet but have a nice day</span>"<br />
But it's gone noon, they're still in bed, they're far behind in the USA.<br />
    <br />
Americans are behind,<br />
Americans are behind,<br />
Americans are behind,<br />
Americans are behind!<br />
<br />
Good Lord, can't you hurry up?<br />
Americans are behind! <br />
Americans, get a move on there! <br />
Good God Boy!<br />
Hardly dressed? Get... get that thing inside your trousers, how dare you!<br />
<br />
At the third stroke we will all be having a jolly good time.<br />
Bip! Bip! Bip!<br />
At the fourth stroke, it will be... <br />
At the fifth stroke...<br />
And the sixth stroke...<br />
Oh, dear!<br />
<br />
Americans are behind, <br />
Americans are behind, <br />
Americans are behind, <br />
Americans are behind! <br />
Americans are behind! <br />
AMERICANS ARE BEHIND!! <br />
   <br />
   AHAHAhAHAHAhaha! <br />
   AhAHAHAHhahah! <br />
   HAHAHAahaha!  <br />
   <br />
Precisely.</p>
