      <h1 class="u">Hiring Camels</h1>

      <p class="left">I was thinking, perhaps we'll never get to egypt, but egypt 

        could come to us:</p>

      <p class="left">If only we could hire us a camel,<br />

        And paint hieroglyphs all upon the wall,<br />

        If only we could hire us a camel,<br />

        We'd have to make sure he stayed out in the hall.<br />If only we could build

        our own pyramid,<br />

        and pay some little chappy to show us 'round.<br />

        If only we could build our own pyramid,<br />

        And sprinkle lots of sand all across the ground.</p>

      <p class="left">Oh we,<br />

        We could be sailing,<br />

        Sailing and wailing,<br />

        Across a sandy sea.<br />

        Oh yes and we,<br />

        We could be dancing,<br />

        Dancing and romancing,<br />

        With pyramidic glee!</p>

      <p class="left">If only we could grow own plam trees,<br />

        I'm sure we could find us a second-hand sphinx.<br />

        If only we could grow our own palm trees,<br />

        Ther grow in colder climates than most people'd think.<br />

        Yeah, right.</p>

      <p class="left">Take that keyboard away!</p>

      <p class="left">No, no, take it away! Would you, please?</p>

      <p class="left">Oh, we! <br />We could be sailing, <br />We could've been wailing, <br />

        Across a sandy sea, <br />

        Oh yes and we, <br />

        We could be dancing, <br />

        Dancing and romancing, with pyramidic glee!</p>

      <p class="left">We, we could be sailing, <br />

        Sailing and wailing, <br />

        Across a sandy sea, full of sandy sea serpents! <br />

        We, would could be dancing, <br />

        Dancing and romancing, <br />

        If only you'd agree. <br />

        Go on, say yes!</p>

      <p class="left">We, we could be we could be sailing, <br />

        Sailing and sailing and sailing and wailing, <br />

        Across an sandy sea, <br />

        Oh yes and we, <br />

        We could be dancing, <br />

        Dancing and romancing, <br />

        With pyramidic glee! <br />

        How great can it be?</p>
