 <h1 class="u">Perfect Today</h1>

      <p class="left">I'm sick of casual sex with strangers,<br />

        Want some strange sex with casualties.<br />

      And you've glued me to the sofa,<br />

        With that strange cigarette that made me wheeze.<br /><br />

      I was gonna try a biscuit but I know I shouldn't risk it,<br />

        After that,<br />

        Spread Eagled on the floor, but I wanna lay down more,<br />

        Wide awake in my coma, Please don't roll me over;
        <br /><br />
        'Coz the furniture's movin' when I feel I could Kiss it,<br />

        The carpet's comin' up my way,<br />

        The ceiling's gone AWOL and I know I'm gonna miss it,<br />

        But I feel Perfect Today,<br />

        Perfect Today!
        <br /><br />
        All this talk it makes me hungry,<br />

        Got a midnight crave for Jaffa Cake <span class="lba">(gotta midnight crave for Jaffa cake)</span><br />

        You've got me in your power,<br />

        Held by chemicals and Gaffa tape
        <br /><br />
        I was gonna try a biscuit but I know I shouldn't risk it,<br />

        After that,<br />

        Spread Eagled on the floor, but I wanna lay down more,<br />

        Wide awake in my coma, Please don't roll me over;
        <br /><br />
        'Coz the furniture's movin' when I feel I could Kiss it,<br />

        The carpet's comin' up my way,<br />

        The ceiling's gone AWOL and I know I'm gonna miss it,<br />

        But I feel Perfect Today,<br />

        Perfect Today! (today, today, today...)<br />
        <br />
        I was gonna try a biscuit but I know I shouldn't risk it,<br />

        <span class="sga">A peid angofio- twll dyn
pob saes!</span>
        <br /><br />
        'Coz the furniture's movin' when I feel I could Kiss it,<br />

        The carpet's comin' up my way,<br />

        The ceiling's gone AWOL and I know I'm gonna miss it,<br />

        But I feel Perfect Today
        <br /><br />
        The chair's started spinnin' me just as I feel lazy,<br />

        My socks are crawlin' away,<br />

        The pictures form the colours while my eye's goin' crazy,<br />

        But I feel Perfect Today,<br />

        Perfect Today!
        <br /><br />
        I feel Perfect Today!<br />

        Perfect Today!
        <br /><br />
        Furniture's movin' when I feel I could Kiss it,<br />But I feel perfect today...</p>
